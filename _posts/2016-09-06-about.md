I am a Ph.D. candidate from Fall 2019 in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.engr.wisc.edu/department/electrical-computer-engineering/). I am advised by [Dr. Robert Nowak](http://nowak.ece.wisc.edu/), [Dr. Josiah Hanna](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jphanna/), and [Dr. Qiaomin Xie](https://qiaominxie.github.io/). I am a graduate research assistant at [Wisconsin Institute of Discovery](https://wid.wisc.edu/people/subhojyoti-mukherjee/). I work in the area of Reinforcement Learning, Active learning, and Multi-armed bandits. Recently I have also started working on incorporating active learning strategies for Large Language Models.


   I was an M.S (Research) scholar in the [Computer Science and Engineering Department, IIT Madras](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/) from January 2015 to July 2018. I was advised by [Dr. Balaraman Ravindran](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/) (CSE Department, IIT Madras) and [Dr. Nandan Sudarsanam](https://doms.iitm.ac.in/index.php/nandan-s) (Department of Management Studies, IIT Madras). I was associated with the [RISE](http://rise.cse.iitm.ac.in/rise1/index.html) lab at IIT Madras. I worked in the area of stochastic and non-stochastic [Multi-Armed Bandit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit) settings.
   
   I completed my B.Tech from [Meghnad Saha Institute of Technology](http://www.msit.edu.in/), Kolkata under [West Bengal University of Technology](http://www.wbut.ac.in/) in 2013.
